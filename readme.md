# Berkeley RDI Website

## Editing the website

Note that it takes up to a few minutes for the update to be reflected on the deployed webpages. Please disable the caching of the browser to see the latest version in the first time.

Also **please do not delete the CNAME in the root directory**, which would cause an error for GitHub page custom domain name.

### Editing the landing page

1. **Update the content**: Change [this markdown file](https://github.com/rdi-berkeley/rdi-berkeley.github.io/blob/main/index.md).

### How to add/update faculty information

1. **Upload their photo**: Go to [this folder](https://github.com/rdi-berkeley/rdi-berkeley.github.io/tree/main/assets/images/people), click "Add file" button, select "Upload files" option, and add the photo file (preferably in the shape of square in `jpg` format).

2. **Update the entry**: Go to [this file](https://github.com/rdi-berkeley/rdi-berkeley.github.io/blob/main/_data/people.yml), click the small pencil button (that has a hint text "Edit this file", or use [this link](https://github.com/rdi-berkeley/rdi-berkeley.github.io/edit/main/_data/people.yml)). You can see how sections are arranged in the file.
    - If you want to create a new entry, just use the same template as below (please be careful with the indentation). Note that for the field of `image_file` you need to enter exactly the same name that you just uploaded to `/assets/images/people` folder.
    ```
        - name: Dawn Song
            homepage: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/
            image_file: dawn.jpg
            subtitle: "Security & Privacy, Blockchain, ML" 
    ```

### How to add/update events

1. **Upload the banner**: Go to the `/assets/images/events` folder and add the banner file. The file should be in the format `M-d.png` (ex. 4-7.png for the April 7 event).

2. **Update the data entry**: Go to `/_data/events/events.yml` and add a new entry at the top of the file. Below is the format of the entry as well as an example:

   > Format
   
   ```
   - link: /events/M-d
     row-title: "TITLE"
     date: "yyyy-MM-dd"
     formatted-date: "MMMMM d"
     start: "h:mm am"
     end: "h:mm pm"
     title: "M/d/yy - TITLE"
     img: /assets/images/events/M-d.png
     location: "" # OPTIONAL
     zoom: "" # OPTIONAL
     description: |
       Description paragraph here. Place <br /><br /> in between paragraphs for separation.
     speakers:
       - name: ""
         description: |
           Description of the speaker here. Place <br /><br /> in between paragraphs for separation.
   ```

   The line marked `<!-- EDIT THIS LINE -->` must be changed within the file. Edit the date in the format of `yyyy-MM-dd` to the correct date of the event.

   ```

   layout: default
