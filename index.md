The Berkeley Center for Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence (RDI) is a new multi-disciplinary campus-wide initiative, focusing on advancing the science, technology and education at the intersection of responsible innovation, decentralization, and AI. The RDI Center currently includes faculty and students from computer science, finance/economics, and law, and will support 3 pillars: research, education, and community / entrepreneurship.

Research areas include safe and secure AI, agentic AI, decentralization technology, decentralized AI and responsible innovation / regulation guidance, etc.

Besides advancing the science, technology and education in this space, responsible innovation is a key aspect of the Center’s mission and goals, where the Center will explore new approaches for analyzing and understanding the societal impact of AI as well as decentralized systems, and help ensure that AI and decentralization technologies will be used in a responsible way to help protect the welfare of individuals and society, protect privacy, level the playing field and empower innovation, promote fairness, inclusiveness, ethics, and explore policy frameworks to support innovation and regulation compliance.

RDI will continue to build upon UC Berkeley’s strong foundation and leadership in these areas, as recently recognized and noted below:
